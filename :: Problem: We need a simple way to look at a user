// Problem: We need a simple way to look at a user's badge count and JavaScript points

//Solution: Use Node.js to connect to Treehouse's API to get profile information to print out 

//Connect to the API URL (http://teamtreehouse.com/username.json)
//Read the data
//Parse the data 
//Print the data


function printMessage(username, badgeCount, points) {
	var message = usernmae + " has " + badgeCount + " total badge(s) and " + points + " points in JavaScript";
}
